## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Interviewers/Experts: Create and manage interview scenarios, evaluate candidates, and provide feedback.
Candidates: Engage in interactive simulations, respond to questions, and receive real-time feedback.
Scenario-Based Simulations: Create realistic interview scenarios that mimic real-life challenges candidates might face in their roles.
Role-Playing Elements: Candidates can take on different roles (e.g., project manager, technical lead) in simulated scenarios, allowing them to demonstrate their skills in various contexts.
Adaptive Questioning: Use AI algorithms to adapt questions based on candidate performance in real-time. If a candidate excels in a particular area, the system can present more challenging questions.
Instant Feedback Mechanism: Provide candidates with immediate feedback after each question or scenario, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
Multi-Dimensional Scoring System: Implement a scoring system that evaluates candidates on various dimensions, such as technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, communication, and teamwork.
Peer Review: Allow interviewers to collaborate and provide peer reviews on candidate performance, ensuring a well-rounded evaluation.
Candidate Dashboard: A personalized dashboard for candidates to track their progress, view feedback, and access resources for improvement.
Interviewer Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard for interviewers to manage candidates, view performance metrics, and generate reports.
Virtual Collaboration Space: Create a virtual space where candidates can collaborate with other candidates or interviewers during simulations, mimicking real-world teamwork.
Discussion Forums: Implement forums for candidates to discuss topics related to their field, fostering a sense of community and engagement.
Performance Analytics: Use data analytics to track candidate performance trends over time, helping to refine the question bank and interview scenarios.
Customizable Reports: Generate customizable reports for interviewers, summarizing candidate performance and providing insights for decision-making.
Engaging UI/UX Design: Develop an engaging and visually appealing interface that enhances the user experience for both candidates and interviewers.
Mobile Compatibility: Ensure the platform is mobile-friendly, allowing candidates to participate in simulations from various devices.
Data Security Measures: Implement robust security protocols to protect candidate data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
User Authentication: Secure login processes for both candidates and interviewers to maintain the integrity of the assessment process.
